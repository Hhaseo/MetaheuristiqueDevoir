INCOP Library version1.1

This C++ library implements local search methods for solving combinatorial optimization problems.

It works on Linux operating system, with g++ (2.95 or 3.3) compiler

The makefile file allows to build the executable files (one per application : for example colorcsp
for graph coloring problemes solved as Max-CSP problems).

The usermanual presents how to use the library to solve the yet implemented problems (extension binary CSPs, graph coloring problems,
clique problems, CELAR frequency assignment problems, random CSPs)  with the implemented methods.

The presentation paper explains the architecture of the software and how one can implement a new metaheuristic
or a new problem by specializing C++ classes.

The documentation presents the classes, attributes and methods.
